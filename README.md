## Purpose

In this project, bacteria cultures were collected from the belly buttons of a sampling of people.  The types and prevalence of the bacteria were recorded, along with the frequency with which each subject washed their belly button.  Here, we attempt to visualize this data on a webpage using html, javascript, and json.

## Results

We successfully generated a bar graph, a bubble graph, and a gauge graph on a webpage.  This visualization updates according to a dropdown menu, from which you can pick a subject.  The graphs will populate with that subject's data, telling you the frequency of belly button scrubs, the top ten bacteria found, and the amount of bacteria found per sample.  In addition, a table will populate with demographic information.

We went a bit further, customizing some of the page's format.  This included adding a background image, adjusting the font to make the title legible, and altering the background color to match.
